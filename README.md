# MC-phantom-gui
This is an independent,minimalistic GUI solution for https://github.com/jhead/phantom, WIP: Currently only the most basic functions of "Phantom" are supported
## Advantages over pure Phantom application
Easier to use for less technical persons. You can add servers to a list which automatically gets saved and started on your next start (easy access to multiple servers on one click). Now using the provided JSON REST API.

# Usage
Download the dist folder and run GUI.exe. Add servers to the list by typing in their address and pressing "connect!". They will appear in the list below. The server should now show up under the "friends tab" in Minecraft bedrock Edition. 

# Dislaimer
This is only a third party GUI for the phantom application from https://github.com/jhead/phantom, the only work done from me is the "GUI.py" and resulting binary files. The software is provided "as is" and I'm not responsible for any problems that may occur, proceed at your own risk.
